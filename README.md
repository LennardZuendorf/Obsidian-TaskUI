## ⚠️ Alpha Status


> [!WARNING]
>**TaskUI is currently in Alpha (v0.3)**. This means:
> - The plugin is functional but may have bugs or incomplete features, and breaking changes may occur between versions.
> - Some features are still under active development
> While interoperable with the Tasks Plugin, currently only the DataView mode is supported (which saves task details as *[[priority::high]]*, etc.).

## Overview

**TaskUI** is a modern task management plugin for Obsidian that provides a comprehensive visual interface for managing tasks within your markdown vault. It seamlessly integrates with the **Tasks** plugin and **DataView**, enabling you to create, edit, and organize tasks through an intuitive UI while keeping all data stored in your markdown files.

TaskUI maintains bidirectional synchronization between the visual interface and your markdown files, ensuring data integrity and allowing you to work with tasks either through the UI or directly in your markdown files.

## Features

### 📊 Multiple View Modes
- **Table View**: Spreadsheet-like interface with sortable columns and inline editing
- **List View**: Card-based list with grouping and expandable sections
- **Board View (Kanban)**: Visual board with drag-and-drop between status columns

### ✨ Task Management
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks through an intuitive interface
- **Task Status Tracking**: Manage tasks with statuses (todo, in-progress, done, cancelled)
- **Priority Levels**: Assign and visualize task priorities
- **Date Management**: Set scheduled dates and due dates with an intuitive date picker
- **Tags Support**: Organize tasks with tags
- **Task Descriptions**: Add detailed descriptions to your tasks

### 🔍 Advanced Organization
- **Grouping**: Group tasks by status, priority, dates, or custom fields
- **Sorting**: Multi-column sorting with visual indicators
- **Filtering**: Filter tasks by various criteria
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large task lists efficiently

### 🔄 Real-Time Synchronization
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in the UI automatically sync to markdown files
- **Conflict Resolution**: Built-in mechanisms to handle sync conflicts

### 🎨 Modern UI
- Built with **React** and **TypeScript** for a responsive, type-safe experience and **TailwindCSS** styling for a modern, clean interface
- **Native Obsidian Theme**, the app follows your Obsidian theme 100% and therefore is also interoperable with other style plugins. 

## Requirements

- **Obsidian** (Desktop only - mobile support not available)
- **Tasks Plugin** - Required for task parsing and management (not mandatory but suggested)
- **DataView Plugin** - Required for task data access (**mandatory**)
